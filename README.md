# Anagram-check
Given two strings, check to see if they are anagrams. An anagram is when the two strings can be written using the exact same letters (so you can just rearrange the letters to get a different phrase or word)


For example;
- 'A gentleman' is an anagram of 'Elegant man'
- 'Schoolmaster' is an anagram of 'The classroom'
